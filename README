INTERNSHIP_HUB
📌 Problem Statement

Finding genuine internship opportunities has always been a major challenge for students:

Students often struggle to identify authentic organizations that provide real internships.

Due to fake listings and lack of transparency, many students end up making wrong choices.

On the other hand, organizations also lack a simple and effective platform to showcase their internship opportunities.

To address this issue, INTERNSHIP_HUB was developed.

Organizations can register themselves and post internship opportunities.

Students can sign up, log in, and browse available internships.

A secure authentication system ensures smooth access for both organizations and students.

The platform is designed to be simple, transparent, and user-friendly.
